## About
The FOSD meeting is an informal meeting designed to bring together researchers working on feature-oriented software development (FOSD). 
It started in 2009 and has since evolved and expanded in what now is an international event. 
Since 2014, the meeting is held in English. 
More details about FOSD and previous FOSD meetings can be found at [fosd.net](http://fosd.net). 
For the [FOSD2016 Workshop](http://fosd.net/workshop2016), please visit FOSD'16 WORKSHOP

The format of the FOSD meeting consists of short presentations from each participant (approx 15 min) with plenty of time for discussion.
Young researchers (graduate and undergraduate students), as well as more senior community members, present their research, provide and get feedback from others, engage into discussions and establish new collaborations.
FOSD is a place for discussion, not a publication venue.
Participants can present previously published work as well as unpublished work, including early ideas and work in progress.
The key is to encourage discussions, to receive feedback and to create a network for new collaboration

An invited talk will be given by Julia Lawall (INRIA)

Every year there is an informal competition, FOSD Cool Wall, where everyone votes for the coolest name of a tool that has been presented during the meeting.

**The deadline for the abstract is January 16th, 2017.**
We will provide notifications one week later. If you need more lead time for visa application or travel planning, reach out to us.
