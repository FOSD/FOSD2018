## About
The FOSD meeting is a yearly informal meeting to bring together researchers working on feature-oriented software development (which includes product lines, software variability, configuration management, software architecture, and more).
The meeting started 9 years ago to bring several research groups with common interests closer together, has successfully been expanded and repeated 9 times with 20 to 50 participants each, and has established countless collaborations since. For example, see [FOSD 2017 in Darmstadt](http://fosd.net/2017) and [FOSD 2016 in Copenhagen](http://fosd.net/2016).

The format of the FOSD meeting consists of short presentations from each participant with plenty of time for discussion.
Young researchers (graduate and undergraduate students), as well as more senior community members, present their research, provide and get feedback from others, engage into discussions and establish new collaborations.
FOSD is a place for discussion, not a publication venue.
Participants can present previously published work as well as unpublished work, including early ideas and work in progress.
The key is to encourage discussions, to receive feedback and to create a network for new collaboration

Every year there is an informal competition, the FOSD Cool Wall (see [fosd.net](http://fosd.net)), where everyone votes for the coolest name of a tool that has been presented during the meeting.

The FOSD meeting 2018 will take place in Gothenburg, Sweden, from June 3 (early afternoon) until June 6, 2018 (evening). Some invitation emails contained slightly different dates, sorry.

**The deadline for the abstract is February 1, 2018.**
FOSD does not require any paper submission and does not have proceedings, though we do expect an abstract about the research that is to be presented and an e-mail address of the participant.
Due to space restrictions, we may have to select participants, but we will send notifications shortly after the abstract deadline.
If you need more lead time for visa application or travel planning, reach out to us.





### Your Talk
This year, every participant has an allocated slot of 25 minutes.
Please prepare slides that do not require more than 13 minutes of presentation such that we have at least half of the slot for discussions.
We will enforce the 13 min time limit strictly.

## Location & Travel Information
The FOSD Meeting 2018 will take place at Chalmers Technical University in Gothenburg, Sweden. Specifically, it will be held at Campus Johanneberg (<http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/premises-and-campus/Pages/find-your-way-to-chalmers.aspx>), which is the larger one of the two Chalmers Campus (the smaller one is at Lindholmen).

All participants will stay in the Quality Hotel Panorama, just a 900m away from the campus:

[Quality Hotel Panorama Gothenburg](http://quality-hotel-panorama.gothenburg-hotels.com/en/)  
Eklandagatan 51-53  
Gothenburg, Sweden

There will be a flat registration fee that covers your stay, all meals, and the social event on Tuesday afternoon.
We will try to organize some drinks at cost price for the evenings. We will organize hotel reservation and payment centrally, covered via the registration fee.

We expect that most participants will arrive Sunday morning (or stay after ICSE and rest for one day) and that depart Thursday morning.

### Arrival via Rail
Exit the train at the central station/the Nils Ericsson terminal.  Take bus 16, destination Högsbohöjd, from the stop Nordstan, just outside the terminal. From Drottningstorget, also just outside the central station, you can take tram 13, heading "Sahlgrenska", to Chalmers. From Brunnsparken, approximately 500 meters from the central station there are additional tram lines that will take you to Chalmers. From there you can walk to the hotel or come directly to the FOSD meeting on campus. Please visit Västtrafik for details.  

### Arrival via Air
Landvetter Airport in Gothenburg has daily flights to and from most major European cities. It is possible to take a Taxi from the airport directly to the hotel, and the price from the airport to the city center is around SEK 400 (45€).

There is also a convenient airport bus service that connects Landvetter Airport to the Central Station in Gothenburg. The bus stop is right outside the airport’s entrance and 2-4 buses run every hour. The travel time to the Central Station is about 30 minutes, and the trip costs SEK 105 (approximately 11 €). The buses are called Flygbussarna and tickets can be purchased online (and shown to the driver on the mobile phone), via totems at the airport, or directly on the bus (a bit more expensive). If you want to use these busses to get to Chalmers Johanneberg Campus or to the hotel, get off the airport bus at station Korsvägen. It is the first stop when the bus arrives Gothenburg, after only 15min travel time.
